A BIOPROSTHETIC STENT-VALVE IS PRESENT IN THE AORTIC POSITION. THERE IS TRACE PARAVALVULAR AORTIC REGURGITATION. THE PEAK TRANSAORTIC GRADIENT IS 20.0MMHG. THE MEAN TRANSAORTIC GRADIENT IS 12.0MMHG. POST TRANSSEPTAL PROCEDURE ASD WITH LEFT TO RIGHT SHUNTING. THE IVC DIAMETER IS 24MM. THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA DEMONSTRATES LESS THAN 50% COLLAPSE CONSISTENT WITH ELEVATED RIGHT ATRIAL PRESSURE (8MMHG). MILD DILATED LEFT ATRIUM. NORMAL LEFT VENTRICULAR SIZE. SEVERE DEPRESSED LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. LV EJECTION FRACTION IS 20%. MILD LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY. LEFT VENTRICULAR DIASTOLIC FUNCTION IS INDETERMINATE IN THIS STUDY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MITRAL VALVE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. TWO MITRACLIPS ARE SEEN ON THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR LEAFLETS OF THE MITRAL VALVE. THERE IS MILD MITRAL VALVE REGURGITATION. THE PEAK TRANSMITRAL GRADIENT IS 9.0MMHG. THE MEAN TRANSMITRAL GRADIENT IS 3.0MMHG. NORMAL PERICARDIUM WITH NO PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. NOT WELL VISUALIZED. ESTIMATED PA PRESSURE IS 40.0MMHG. PA SYSTOLIC PRESSURE IS CONSISTENT WITH MILD PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. THE PULMONARY VENOUS FLOW PATTERN IS DIASTOLIC PREDOMINANT, SUGGESTIVE OF ELEVATED LEFT ATRIAL PRESSURE. PULMONIC VALVE NOT WELL VISUALIZED. THERE IS TRIVIAL PULMONIC REGURGITATION. TOTAL WALL MOTION SCORE IS 2.29. THERE IS AKINESIS OF THE ENTIRE INFEROLATERAL WALL. THERE IS AKINESIS OF THE MID TO APICAL INFERIOR WALL. THERE IS AKINESIS OF THE APICAL CAP. THE REMAINING LEFT VENTRICULAR SEGMENTS DEMONSTRATE HYPOKINESIS. RESTING SEGMENTAL WALL MOTION ANALYSIS. MODERATE DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM. NORMAL RIGHT VENTRICULAR SIZE. NORMAL RIGHT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. ECHO DENSITY IN RIGHT VENTRICLE SUGGESTIVE OF CATHETER, PACER LEAD, OR ICD LEAD. NORMAL APPEARANCE OF THE TRICUSPID VALVE. EST RV/RA PRESSURE GRADIENT IS 32.0MMHG. ESTIMATED PEAK RVSP IS 40MMHG. THERE IS MILD TO MODERATE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION. OTHER NONRHEUMATIC MITRAL VALVE DISORDERS OTHER NONRHEUMATIC AORTIC VALVE DISORDERS AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT. S/P TAVR. THE STUDY IMAGES ARE OF TECHNICALLY ADEQUATE QUALITY.
